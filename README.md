# CreateApe - Front-End Test Project
This is the CreateApe front-end test project, where you'll find the files and info needed to create the required test page.

The included project itself should be used as a reference, to review how we set up HTML/CSS/JS projects, how we structure our HTML markup and how we code our SCSS and JS.

You can also get a more in-depth view of this in our [development standards file](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lGfF2MJtI1-hH_61b8_Li7eq-DmtjnVv-tBghdKJmyg/edit?usp=sharing).

# Steps
Pull in this repo. Review its files, along with [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lGfF2MJtI1-hH_61b8_Li7eq-DmtjnVv-tBghdKJmyg/edit?usp=sharing) to check our front-end dev standards.

Visit [this link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dltgsks9m4y5x3v/AABULShwYX8kuFD-Ro-78gQPa?dl=0) and download the PSD files there. These files are the large and small format comps for the page you'll be working on.

Code the page. This needs to be a pure HTML/CSS/JS page. The only hard requirements are:
1. [Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/) (You don't need to use the whole library if you don't need it)
2. SASS
3. [Slick Carousel](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) (For the pricing columns carousel on small formats)
4. A task runner/build tool (You can use whichever you're comfortable with here, but, as you can see, we use Gulp)

There are only two JS interactions on the page that need to be coded:
1. The menu collapse on small formats.
2. The pricing columns switch to a carousel on small formats.

You can use any other plugins/libraries you want that can help you, but try not to depend too much on them.

After you're done coding the site, zip up your files and send them over to us. Please include your `package.json` file and your `gulpfile.js/Gruntfile.js/whatevertheheckyoureusing.js` file.

Happy Coding!!
